#Task 2: Utilize collections to represent a simple database of books. Implement queries to find books by a specific author or within a certain genre.

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, genre):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.genre = genre

class BookDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, title, author, genre):
        book = Book(title, author, genre)
        self.books.append(book)

    def find_books_by_author(self, author):
        return [book for book in self.books if book.author == author]

    def find_books_by_genre(self, genre):
        return [book for book in self.books if book.genre == genre]

database = BookDatabase()

database.add_book("Diary of a Wimpy Kid", "Jeff Kinney", "Children's Fiction")
database.add_book("Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life", "Bryan Lee O'Malley", "Graphic Novel")
database.add_book("Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "J.K. Rowling", "Fantasy")

author_books = database.find_books_by_author("J.K. Rowling")
print("Books by J.K. Rowling:")
for book in author_books:
    print(f"{book.title} - {book.genre}")

genre_books = database.find_books_by_genre("Graphic Novel")
print("\nGraphic Novels:")
for book in genre_books:
    print(f"{book.title} - {book.author}")
